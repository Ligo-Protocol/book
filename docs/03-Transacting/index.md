title: "Transacting"
---

**Transacting** is about how peers transact with each other.

The core model of a transaction is a [LigoAgreement](../Reference/Schema/LigoAgreement). This section also describes transacting using the [LigoSafeEscrow](../Reference/Schema/LigoPaymentMethod/LigoSafeEscrow) payment method. This is the primary payment method being developed, however more may be added in the future.
