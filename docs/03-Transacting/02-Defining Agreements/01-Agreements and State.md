A booking is comprised of two parts: the _state_ and _agreement_.

The _state_ of a booking contains information needed to exchange value and services (e.g. the state of the vehicle, messages, photos, etc).

The _agreement_ defines how _state_ can change and how the agreement itself can change.

The agreement may define how changes in one state lead to changes in another state. For example, an agreement may define that if the state of mileage is above a certain amount, the balances will change in order to deduct fees.
