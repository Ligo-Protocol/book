During an agreement, certain parties may need certain capabilities to perform actions. For example, in a car sharing agreement the renter will need to have the capability to lock, unlock, and drive a vehicle during a specified time window.

Agreements can use the [object-capability model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model) to define transferable rights to perform certain actions.

## Example: SmartCar Proxy

The following example shows how a potential SmartCar proxy could allow guests to control a vehicle using the OCAP model.
