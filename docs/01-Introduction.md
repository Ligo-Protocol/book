Ligo is an open sharing economy platform.

Our mission is to increase competition among builders in the sharing economy by creating an open platform that allows anyone to create diverse sharing solutions.

The initial area Ligo is focusing on is **car sharing**. The car sharing market has high demand, but a wide range of needs depending on the community. This is a great opportunity for an open platform to compete as large platforms are not serving the needs of various niche communities.

The initial design described here is a work in progress and is changing rapidly. Feel free to leave comments and provide feedback at the bottom of each page.
