There are inherently some rules that are not objective and cannot be determined by computers alone.

A current example is cleaning fees. How can a computer decide whether a car is dirty enough to charge extra cleaning fees? They cannot today. Note: this could turn into an objective rule one day if an AI is used to determine how dirty a car is.

There is actually a spectrum between subjective and objective. Particularly in the AI case, is it the lack of human input required that makes it objective? Or would an AI still be considered subjective?

Celeste is a candidate for a subjective oracle that could be used to resolve disputes like the example above.

Kleros Court can be used for subjective disputes. Examples include:
- Cleaning fees
- Charging reimbursements
- Road toll reimbursements
