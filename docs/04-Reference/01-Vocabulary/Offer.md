## Usage
Offers are the main entity used for discovering rentals as well as setting the foundation of an agreement.

- Marketplaces can discover and show offers
- Oracles can view the offer to resolve disputes

### Private Sharing
Offers can still be made private by using encryption and/or private channels to communicate offers. Offers do not inherently have to be discovered or indexed publicly.

## Examples
### Eligible Quantities
#### Minimum of 5 day booking
```json
{
  "@type": "OfferForLease",
  "eligibleQuantity": {
    "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
    "minValue": 5,
    "unitCode": "DAY"
  }
}
```
