## Usage
The `LigoAgreement` contains two sides of an agreement. An `order` defines the payment being provided by a customer to a seller and a `reservation` defines the service being provided by a seller to a customer.

The `LigoAgreement` defines how state can change in a booking. This is the object that can be used when resolving disputes. See [Agreements and State](../../03-Transacting/02-Defining%20Agreements/01-Agreements%20and%20State.md).

The `LigoAgreement` should be encrypted and sent to the `seller` of the `Offer` to request a booking as described in [Request a Booking](../../03-Transacting/01-Creating%20Agreements/01-Request%20a%20Booking.md).
