Both the agreement and most of the state are private, encrypted Ceramic documents.

The controller of these Ceramic documents is a `did:safe` representing the Gnosis Safe used to store booking funds and linking peer identities together.

Under the [Safe DID](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/accounts/safe-did/), both parties must sign any changes made to either document. If both parties agree on some change to the state or agreement, the process is straightforward.

**Update**: This was incorrect. Safe DID allows _any_ not _all_ signers to sign commits for a document. This approach will not work.
