The _state_ of a booking contains information needed to exchange value and services.

The _agreement_ defines how _state_ can change and how the agreement itself can change.

The agreement may define how changes in one state lead to changes in another state. For example, an agreement may define that if the state of mileage is above a certain amount, the balances will change in order to deduct fees. It may also define that the state of mileage can only change if a third-party, say Smartcar, says it changed.

```
Source of truth for `mileage` is Smartcar -> If `mileage` > 1000 -> $50 is deducted from `balances`

## Disputes

[[202102151557 Car Sharing Dispute Resolution]] Disputes can be made at any state change. In this example:
- Parties may disagree on the `mileage` that Smartcar says
- Parties may disagree that the mileage limit was 1000
- Parties may disagree that the fee was $50

[[202102151558 Car Sharing Objective Rules]] In many scenarios, the state changes can be so well-defined and objective that it is irrational for parties to ever disagree. This is why state changes are **optimistic**. That is, oracles are not needed until there is a dispute, because both parties are heavily incentivized to agree on what the oracle will say.
